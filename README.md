Hi! I'm Tanner
=======================================================================================================================================

I'm a Senior ML Engineer at [Visa AI Platform](https://visa.com) building an MLOps Web Platform for Model deployment, management and much more. 

As an ML Engineer with expertise in web engineering and design, I bring a unique skillset to AI/ML teams of Data Scientists, Researchers and Engineers by building and designing usable and accessible platforms that users can leverage to bring their ML workloads from research to product.

I have played a pivotal role in transforming user experiences, particularly in designing UX for AI-powered business intelligence and an admin UI for Visa fraud detection platform.

Prior to Visa, my tenure at Scalable Commerce involved leading a team in CRM platform development and migrating web applications to containerized AWS workloads, where I significantly improved customer service efficiency and retention rates.

My technical proficiency spans across a broad spectrum, from frontend technologies React and NextJS to backend technologies like Go, NodeJS, Express, and various databases. Additionally, I possess skills in DevOps, utilizing tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform and more.

✨ I enjoy writing ✍🏼 and teaching 📚 all about the Web and Distributed Systems.

In my free time, you will find me out on the golf course or camping ⛺️
