I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer working at [Visa](https://visa.com) building Visa's next generation Data & AI Platform. 

I am an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer with a deep passion for Web Development. My primary goal is to bridge the gap between complex data and end users by creating interactive web experiences that make information accessible and engaging.

Not only do I enjoy making data experiences better, but I am very passionate about productivity and I enjoy building applications that make life easier and more engaging.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects and deliver comprehensive solutions. I thrive on the challenge of transforming intricate data sets into user-friendly interfaces that empower individuals to make informed decisions and gain valuable insights.

Beyond my technical proficiency, I am a collaborative team player who values effective communication and enjoys working in dynamic environments. I thrive on constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in the fields of web development and big data.

I enjoy writing ✍🏼 and teaching 📚 all about the web and data. 

On my free time you will find me out on the golf course or camping ⛺️
